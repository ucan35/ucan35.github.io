        <h1>Making Terminal Your Home</h1><time>February 1, 2021</time></header><p>Home is where you feel comfortable and safe. It&rsquo;s your place that you can organize stuff to your convention.
The very same feeling with your with your terminal can empower you and increase your productivity greatly.</p>
<p>The reason why I prefer terminals is not because that they make you cool. While I don&rsquo;t deny that they indeed
make you cool, the main reason is that they provide you only the most essential data, text streams.
Terminals provide you the most condensed data over sole texts. This enables you to enhance your focus and
increase your perception. Small and simple programs as building blocks lets you to implement more complex
solutions. Of course, this is thanks to GNU<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and other Linux tools.</p>
<p>For me, they are the great product of the Unix philosophy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write programs that do one thing and do it well.</li>
<li>Write programs to work together.</li>
<li>Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>I firmly believe that making yourself comfortable with terminals enables you a great potential. That is why I
would like to give you some basic but effective features that I use in my environment. This post will be
mostly based on my dotfiles<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Before we jump on, I recommend you switch to <code>en-US</code> keyboard layout when interacting with terminal
applications. Most of the time, the shortcuts are designed with <code>en-US</code> keyboard layout in mind. For this
reason, having two keyboard layouts one for your native layout and one for <code>en-US</code> would be beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-search">Reverse search</h2>
<p>Often times I forget a command I have issued before, or I don&rsquo;t want type it over again. Terminals have a
buffer and history file that holds records of past commands. The file is pointed via <code>HISTFILE</code> environment
variable. While you can click up arrow in your keyboard to iterate over most recent commands, terminals also
have <code>reverse search</code> functionality.</p>
<p>This functionality is bound to <code>ctrl-r</code> key combination. After activating <code>reverse search</code> panel, you can
start typing to begin your search from your buffer and history file. Among the results you can navigate and
select the entry you want. In my environment, I have this functionality integrated with <code>fzf</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> which
enhances this even more. The integration of <code>fzf</code> can be found
<a href="https://github.com/ucan35/dotfiles/blob/eb08f61e316de78fcbbd0beebadd44f3e23e3a5c/.config/bash/bashrc#L36">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="directory-navigation">Directory navigation</h2>
<p>It may be the case where you have many directories, or even worse, many nested directories. In situations like
this, the directory navigation can easily turn into torture. I can&rsquo;t image all the <code>cd</code> commands that were
issued into wrong directory. For this reason, <code>fzf</code> has yet another feature called <code>fzf_cd</code>. What this feature
essentially does is It executes <code>find</code> to list all possible directories and enables you to make search on
them. Much like <code>reverse search</code>, except this time upon selecting a entry, <code>fzf</code> automatically takes you there.
On my system this is bound to <code>alt-c</code> key combination.</p>

<h2 id="text-navigation">Text navigation</h2>
<p>Terminals are all about text streams. Invoking applications and providing them arguments are all made via
texts. But we are human beings and we can typo a lot. Sometimes we can notice our typos way after we wrote a
long command. It can be cumbersome to move the cursor over typo and fix it. Terminals have shortcuts for text
navigation. The one I use the most is <code>ctrl-&lt;left/right arrow&gt;</code> key combination to jump over words. There are
also other key combinations to delete words, go to line beginning, crop everything preceding/trailing cursor
and many others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete word <code>ctrl-w</code></li>
<li>Go to line beginning <code>ctrl-a</code></li>
<li>Crop everything preceding cursor <code>ctrl-u</code></li>
<li>Crop everything trailing cursor <code>ctrl-k</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tmux">Tmux</h2>
<p>We may need multiple terminals at the same time depending on the task we are busy with. Switching between
multiple terminal windows and aligning them can be a burden. That&rsquo;s where Tmux<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> comes into play. Tmux
stands for terminal multiplexer. It has features like splitting panes, creating windows and sessions.</p>
<p>Tmux is highly customizable to fit into your convention. I find the default key combinations of Tmux
confusing. You can my customized key combinations
<a href="https://github.com/ucan35/dotfiles/blob/eb08f61e316de78fcbbd0beebadd44f3e23e3a5c/.config/tmux/main.conf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Not only the key combinations, the theme is customizable as well. In fact, you can find my minimal theme
customization at
<a href="https://github.com/ucan35/dotfiles/blob/eb08f61e316de78fcbbd0beebadd44f3e23e3a5c/.config/tmux/style.conf#L1">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As for parting words, I would like to share a final act to show you my daily development environment combining
all the tools to show you much more is possible with terminals. Hope that can inspire and motivate you into
terminals.</p>
